# Project: Document Clustering with Hadoop MapReduce


- Apply `Hadoop MapReduce` to handle document clustering task.

- Each document will be convert into a vector representation using `TF-IDF` feature

- Using `K-Means` algorithm to cluster

- Expected result: groups similar documents together based on their content. This tasks will be powerful in context of Big Data (using distributed system and large-scale data).
